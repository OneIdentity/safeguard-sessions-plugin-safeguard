###### Common plugin options ######
# To enable or change a parameter, uncomment its line by removing the ';'
# character and replacing the right side of '=' with the desired value.
# If the parameter has the following structure
# ; name=<value>
# then the related option is turned off until you replace '<value>'.
#
# If the parameter has the following structure
# ; name=value
# then the related option is is automatically turned on with the default value
# of 'value'.
#
# To handle sensitive data, you can use a local Credential Store to retrieve
# parameters from.
# Enter the name of the local Credential Store (Policies > Credential Store) as
# the value of the 'name' parameter in section [credential_store]. To retrieve a
# parameter from this Credential Store, type the $ character as the value of
# a parameter in this configuration file. To use the $ character as value,
# type $$ instead. For more information, read the "Store sensitive plugin data
# securely" section in the Tutorial document.
